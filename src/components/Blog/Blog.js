      FINALLY finished. That took forever.
      <br/><br/>
      Of course, I still did 70% of it incorrectly.
      <br/>
      But thats 30% I now have correct!
      <br/>
      Slowly going to keep refactoring it and learning.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I might take a break to do some pixel art + game programming within the next few days.

      Well, it's time for an upgrade.
      <br/><br/>
      A user named <a href="https://github.com/Smolations"><white>github.com/Smolations</white></a>, with 20+ years of experience, joined my <a href="twitch.tv/codeforf00d"><white>twitch</white></a> and gave me a crash course on project architecture in ReactJS.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Needless to say, I am now refactoring this entire website.
      <br/><br/>
      Shouldn't take too long.
      <br/><br/>
      Being able to improve your skillset through teachings from experts in their field is one the best qualities the internet can offer.

      <h3><purple>LOTS OF LEARNING AND SOME PROGRESS</purple><white> NOV 3rd,2021</white><hr/></h3>
      I have only really dived in to web development since starting this website.
      <br/><br/>
      Currently using ReactJS and its quite addictive!
      As of right now I have a pretty good understanding of:
      <ul>
      <li>POST,GET,USE requests</li>
      <li>SMTP Email Backend</li>
      <li>User Authentication</li>
      <li>SQL Database Authentication</li>
      </ul>
      Just the thoughts of a novice; so far it feels like web development is 45% server setup, 45% designing, and 10% coding.
      <br/><br/>
      I have database backend half done, emailing backend basics finished, and alerts added. Also changed around the  pallette
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Too pink??
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Productive day.


      <h3><purple>FEELING SLOW TODAY</purple><white> OCT 30th,2021</white><hr/></h3>
      Prolong nerd activies cause a little bit of brain fog.


      <h3><purple>WEBSITE UPDATE!</purple><white> OCT 30th,2021</white><hr/></h3>
      Updated the website, looks hell of a lot better. Still mediocre in many ways. Need to add a SQL database and user functionality.
      <br/><br/>My mom told me all the cool kids are doing it.
      <br/><br/>
      Now I have to find out how to add it... and maybe make a tutorial on it after. That's what course gurus would do, right?

      Someone had the username CodeForFood so I had to replace it with zeros. That sucks.
      <br/><br/>Streaming the development of this website, along with potentially tutorials among other things.
      <br/><br/>Also streaming gaming every now and again.
