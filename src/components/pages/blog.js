      I have only really dived in to web development since starting this website.
      <br/><br/>
      Currently using ReactJS and its quite addictive!
      As of right now I have a pretty good understanding of:
      <ul>
      <li>POST,GET,USE requests</li>
      <li>SMTP Email Backend</li>
      <li>User Authentication</li>
      <li>SQL Database Authentication</li>
      </ul>
      Just the thoughts of a novice; so far it feels like web development is 45% server setup, 45% designing, and 10% coding.
      <br/><br/>
      Tools:
      <ul>
      <li>Atom IDE</li>
      <li>React + NodeJs</li>
      <li>Postman</li>
      <li>MYSQL Workbench</li>
      </ul>
      OS:
      <ul>
      <li>Linux -> Kubuntu 20.04</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Continued<hr/></h4>
      I have database backend half done, emailing backend basics finished, and alerts added. Also changed around the color pallette

      Too pink??

      Productive day.
      <h3><colorpurple>FEELING SLOW TODAY</colorpurple><colorwhite> OCT 30th,2021</colorwhite><hr/></h3>
      Prolong nerd activies cause a little bit of brain fog.
      <h3><colorpurple>WEBSITE UPDATE!</colorpurple><colorwhite> OCT 30th,2021</colorwhite><hr/></h3>
      Updated the website, looks hell of a lot better. Still mediocre in many ways. Need to add a SQL database and user functionality.
      <br/><br/>My mom told me all the cool kids are doing it.
      <br/><br/>
      Now I have to find out how to add it... and maybe make a tutorial on it after. That's what course gurus would do, right?

      Someone had the username CodeForFood so I had to replace it with zeros. That sucks.
      <br/><br/>Streaming the development of this website, along with potentially tutorials among other things.
      <br/><br/>Also streaming gaming every now and again.
