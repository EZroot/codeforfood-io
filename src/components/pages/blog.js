      Just realized why, I've been up almost all night working on:
      <ul>
      <li>this</li>
      <li>client projects</li>
      <li>C# algorithm tutorials</li>
      <li>pixel art</li>
      <li>little bit of twitch stuff</li>
      </ul>
      It's a good thing I love what I do. ^_^
      <h3><colorpurple>WEBSITE UPDATE!</colorpurple><colorwhite> OCT 30th,2021</colorwhite><hr/></h3>
      Updated the website, looks hell of a lot better. Still mediocre in many ways. Need to add a SQL database and user functionality.
      <br/><br/>My mom told me all the cool kids are doing it.
      <br/><br/>
      Now I have to find out how to add it... and maybe make a tutorial on it after. That's what course gurus would do, right?

      Someone had the username CodeForFood so I had to replace it with zeros. That sucks.
      <br/><br/>Streaming the development of this website, along with potentially tutorials among other things.
      <br/><br/>Also streaming gaming every now and again.
