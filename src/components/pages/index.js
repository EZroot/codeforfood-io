    <h3><colorwhite>Newfoundland Game Studio</colorwhite><hr/></h3>
    Living in rural Canada is damn near free, but food isn't. Thus...

    Just a small group of passionate gamers devoted to creating highly-polished, entertaining and marketable games.
    <h3><colorwhite>Now What?</colorwhite><hr/></h3>
    Now we are currently in the planning stages of our game development.
